# TTC-Tracker
A project that aims to allows users to have easy and intuitive access to Toronto TTC data through an interactive map. Our project aims to do three things: display a map of all non-subway TTC stops, predict arrival times of non-subway TTC vehicles, and suggest the three quickest routes to a user given a starting and ending point

### Running the Backend

1. Navigate to the `./backend/src/main/java/com/example/backend/` directory using the command line.

2. Run the `BackendApplication.java` file located there.

   This will start the backend server, and it will be accessible at http://localhost:8080.

### Running the Frontend

1. Navigate to the `./frontend` directory using the command line.

2. Run the following command to start the development server:

   ```plaintext
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will build the frontend and launch the development server. You can access the frontend application in your web browser at http://localhost:3000.
