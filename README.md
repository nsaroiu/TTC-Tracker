# TTC-Tracker
A project that aims to allows users to have easy and intuitive access to Toronto TTC data through an interactive map. Our project aims to do three things: display a map of all non-subway TTC stops, predict arrival times of non-subway TTC vehicles, and suggest the three quickest routes to a user given a starting and ending point
